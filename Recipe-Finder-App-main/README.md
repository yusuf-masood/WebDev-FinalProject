# Web-Dev-FinalProject

# 🍽️ Recipe Finder App (Frontend Only)

This is the **frontend** of our Recipe Finder App, built using **Angular**. The application allows users to browse, search, and view recipes with a user-friendly interface. The backend integration and full functionality (such as user authentication, recipe uploads, and saving favorites) will be developed in the upcoming days.
